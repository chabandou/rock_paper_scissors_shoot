## Introduction to Rock, Paper, Scissors, SHOOT!

Rock, Paper, Scissors, SHOOT! is a twist on the classic game of Rock, Paper, Scissors. So the same rules you already know apply in this game too.

## It's Card Game:

In this game each player gets a deck of 10 cards:

6 of them are the classic (Basic) Rock, Paper, Scissors, two of each represented as playing cards
The 4 others are special cards called Power-Cards that are specific to this game.



## The ❝Power❞ of the Power-Cards:

Power-Cards can be two types "Shoot" & "Pan" (yes, the kitchen utensil, clearly I was hungry when I came up with this).
Shoot card can beat all basic RPS cards, but you have to be carful because it can be countered by the Pan card and causes reverse damage.

## Flow of the Game & Goal:

The game plays in rounds, each round the player and their opponent both choose a card to play (choose the play button on a card's menu to play it) similar to choosing a rock, paper or scissors in classic RPS, the cards are then revealed on the field and the player with the more poweful card wins that round and deals damage to the loser's health points.

Most cards deal 1 damage but "Shoot" fusions (more on fusions below) deal 2 or more damage.
The game is won if you deplete your opponent's health to 0 or get them to run out of cards.
